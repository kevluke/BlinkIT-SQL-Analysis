# BlinkIT Grocery Data - SQL Cleaning & Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing the BlinkIT Grocery dataset using SQL.  
The dataset contains information about grocery sales, outlet types, sizes, and product categories.  
The goal was to apply SQL techniques for data cleaning, transformation, and deriving business insights.

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, standardizing categories)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (aggregations, grouping, subqueries, window functions)

## Repository Structure
- `queries.sql` -> Contains all SQL scripts for cleaning & analysis  
- `dataset_sample.csv` -> A small sample of the dataset (for schema reference) 
- `Requirement Analysis.pptx` -> objectives + business questions.
- `results.csv` -> Example outputs of key queries (aggregated sales, outlet size breakdown, etc.)   
- `LICENSE` -> Open-source license  

## Key Insights
- Sales contribution by different outlet sizes and locations  
- Performance comparison of product categories  
- Identification of high-revenue outlets  
- Trends in sales distribution across different item types  

## How to Run
1. Import the BlinkIT dataset into your SQL environment.  
2. Open `sql_queries script.sql` and run the scripts step by step.  
3. Explore the results (sample outputs provided in `results.doc`).  

## Dataset
The dataset represents sales transactions and outlet details from BlinkIT grocery stores.  
(*Dataset used for analytics practice*)
